    "- Scrape pages of newspapers to get information around important historical events (e.g. elections, major reforms, armed conflicts)\n",
    "- Compare prices of different products by scraping the pages\n",
    "- Find the cheapest flight tickets for your dream holidays!\n",

    "We first need to understand some basics on how the web works and how we can access the data in the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTTP\n",
    "HTTP or Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol used for communication between distributed and multi-layered systems on the web. The foundation of the web as we know today (the world wide web) uses HTTP as the main data communication protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP functions as a request-response protocol, or in an active fashion, meaning that one end issues a \"request\" and the other end receives the request and responds with a \"response\". This is a generic and more of a high-level explanation, but just have in mind that the response can be pretty much anything that is parseable (a JSON document, XML, HTML, an integer number, a URL...you name it).\n",
    "\n",
    "The classic example of how this work is when you browse the web. Usually speaking, there is a server (or multiple) hosting the website you are accessing that will be in charge of receiving the requests and responding with the website pages (serving them to you). In this case your browser will be known as the \"client\" and the server, well, it's known as the \"server\" \n",

    "- HTML: contain the main content of the page\n",
    "- CSS : the styling (makes the page look snazzy)\n",

    "### Verbs / Methods\n",
    "These define the action that should be performed on the the host:\n",
    "\n",
    "- HTTP GET: Requests a representation of the specified resource (Document, HTML Page, Picture, JSON, XML...). Using the GET method should only retrieve data and should have no other effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- HTTP POST: Requests that the server accept the data enclosed in it's request body as a new resource to be persisted on it's end. The data POSTed might be for instance a new user that registered in your website, a new message on an instant messaging app, a comment on a thread etc. Usually speaking, it's something that the server will store on it's end for later consumption, processing or usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- HTTP HEAD: The HEAD request is identical to the GET request, but instead of receiving the full payload of the response, it receives only meta-information about the server (also known as the response headers). This is useful for understanding what is running on the server (or how it reacts to different requests), without having to tranport the entire content of a standard response.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- HTTP PUT: Similar to the POST request, but this one suplies an URI (identifier) that should be used by the server to persist the object transported by the PUT request. The catch here is that if an object with the same URI already exists on the server side, it should be overwritten by the one received (this operation is also known as UPSERT or Merge operation. If the record does not exist, it will be inserted, otherwise it will be updated).\n",

Because HTML isn't a programming language, it isn't nearly as complex as Python.\n",

    "- `parent` — a parent is the tag another tag is inside. Above, the html tag is the parent of the body tag.\n",
    "- `sibiling` — a sibiling is a tag that is nested inside the same parent as another tag. For example, head and body are siblings, since they're both inside `html`. Both `p` tags are siblings, since they're both inside body.\n",

    "\n",
    "On July 21, 2017, the New York Times updated an opinion article called [Trump's Lies](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/23/opinion/trumps-lies.html), detailing every public lie the President has told since taking office. Because this is a newspaper, the information was (of course) published as a block of text. This is a great format for human consumption, but it can't easily be understood by a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Python to analyse the data published then! This is how the text looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![](assets/article_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When converting this into a dataset, you can think of each lie as a \"record\" with four fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The date of the lie.\n",
    "2. The lie itself (as a quotation).\n",
    "3. The writer's brief explanation of why it was a lie.\n",
    "4. The URL of an article that substantiates the claim that it was a lie.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, those fields have different formatting, which is consistent throughout the article: the date is bold red text, the lie is \"regular\" text, the explanation is gray italics text, and the URL is linked from the gray italics text.\n",
    "\n",

His lack of truthfulness has also become central to the Russia investigation, with James Comey, the former director of the F.B.I., testifying under oath about Trump\\'s “lies, plain and simple.”</p>\\n\\n\\n    </div>\\n\\n    \\n\\n    \\n      <div class=\"g-item g-text \">\\n    \\n\\n      <p class=\"g-body\">There is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/14/opinion/sunday/trump-lies-obama-who-is-worse.html\">simply no precedent</a> for an American president to spend so much time telling untruths. Every president has shaded the truth or told occasional whoppers. No other president — of either party — has behaved as Trump is behaving. He is trying to create an atmosphere in which reality is irrelevant.</p>\\n\\n\\n    </div>\\n\\n    \\n\\n    \\n      <div class=\"g-item g-text \">\\n    \\n\\n      <p class=\"g-body\">We have set a conservative standard here, leaving out many dubious statements (like the claim that the tax bill his administration supports is “the biggest tax cut in U.S. history.”). Some people may still take issue with this standard, arguing that the president wasn\\'t speaking literally. But we believe his long pattern of using untruths to serve his purposes, as a businessman and politician, means that his statements are not simply careless errors.</p>\\n\\n\\n    </div>\\n\\n    \\n\\n    \\n      <div class=\"g-item g-text \">\\n    \\n\\n      <p class=\"g-body\">We are using the word “lie” deliberately. Not every falsehood is deliberate on Trump\\'s part. But it would be the height of naïveté to imagine he is merely making honest mistakes. He is lying.</p>\\n\\n\\n    </div>\\n\\n    \\n\\n    \\n      <div class=\"g-item g-subhed \">\\n    \\n\\n      <h2>Trump Told Public Lies or Falsehoods Every Day for His First 40 Days</h2>\\n\\n\\n    </div>\\n\\n    \\n\\n    \\n      <div class=\"g-item g-text \">\\n    \\n\\n      <p class=\"g-body\">The list above uses the conservative standard of demonstrably false statements. By that standard, Trump told a public lie on at least 20 of his first 40 days as president. But based on a broader standard — one that includes his many misleading statements (like exaggerating military spending in the Middle East) — Trump achieved something remarkable: He said something untrue, in public, every day for the first 40 days of his presidency.
